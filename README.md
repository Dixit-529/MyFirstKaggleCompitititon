# MyFirstKaggleCompitititon
This is the first time ever kaggle compitition and this is my first try for that.
And got 77% accuracy. i know this is low but for me i am very happy with by considering this is my first try.
got 1679 rank out of 2689 teams but its ok.

In this project i am given Dataset which contain all data about passenger with labeled whether he/she reached his/her destination or not.
Then i have to analyze through this dataset and decide appropriate machine learning algorithm to predict whether passenger will reach his/her destination or not.
